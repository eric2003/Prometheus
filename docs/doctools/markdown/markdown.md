## Headings

`Just like HTML, Markdown has six levels of headings. Headings in Markdown are created by putting one to six # in front of your heading text with a space separating the # and text. Each # represents a heading level with # being the largest heading and ###### being the smallest heading. Here is an example of all six heading levels.`

input:
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

###### Heading 6
```

## Paragraphs

input:
```
This is a paragraph.
  
Since there is a new line between these two sentences they will be converted to two separate paragraphs.

This paragraph
has two spaces HERE  
so it will push this onto a new line within the same paragraph.
```
